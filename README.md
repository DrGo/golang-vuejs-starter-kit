# golang-vuejs-starter-kit

> This is a starter kit that can be cloned to get started with golang and vuejs.

> Static files can be served out of the dist directory. The golang server will be built into src/goLang/.bin. Be sure to edit the makefile to suite your needs.

> This project is a slight modification of the standard vue-cli project built with `vue init webpack myProject` with no linting or testing options used.
